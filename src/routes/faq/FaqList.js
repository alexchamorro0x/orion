    question: "How Does Orion Digital Consulting work?",

    question: "How many followers should I expect?",
    answer:
      "While Orion Digital Consulting will get you plenty of organic traffic to your Instagram account, the likelihood of converting those visitors into followers depends vastly on the quality of your content, as well as other parameters.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does my account have to be in specific industry?",
    answer:
      "You should know who else sells in your market. You canâ€™t easily describe a type of business without describing the nature of the participants. There is a huge difference, for example, between an industry like broadband television services, in which there are only a few huge companies in any one country, and one like dry cleaning, in which there are tens of thousands of smaller participants.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I need more followers?",
    answer:
      "For both sales and building professional relationships having a large following is essential. This is because followers make a business look more reliable. It is a source of credibility for users. Customers tend to trust those brands that have already built a following. They take them more seriously.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work manually?",
    answer:
      "AI will replace all tedious and time-consuming manual processes, allowing humans to focus on high-value tasks.",

  },
  {
    question: "What happens after I sign up?",
