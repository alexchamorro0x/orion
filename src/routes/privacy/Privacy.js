            <p className="bold-text">Image and Audio Information</p>
            <p>
              We may collect information about the images and audio that are a
              part of your User Content, such as identifying the objects and

              under US laws, such as faceprints and voiceprints, from your User
              Content. Where required by law, we will seek any required

            <p className="bold-text">Metadata</p>
            <p>
              When you upload or create User Content, you automatically upload
              certain metadata that is connected to the User Content. Metadata
              describes other data and provides information about your User
              Content that will not always be evident to the viewer. In
              connection with your User Content the metadata can describe how,
              when, where, and by whom the piece of User Content was created,
              collected, or modified and how that content is formatted. It also
              includes information, such as your account name, that enables
              other users to trace back the User Content to your user account.
              Additionally, metadata includes data that you choose to provide
              with your User Content, e.g. any hashtags used to mark keywords to
              the video and captions.
