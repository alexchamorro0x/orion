              his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if
              known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her
              settlement with the debtor or released party.” If you are a
              resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute
              or doctrine.

                This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is
                referred to in this Terms of Service as the “Arbitration
                Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that
                have arisen or may arise between you and Orion Digital
                Consulting, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of
                Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services,
                any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions
                between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and
                binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the
                terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert
                individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.
                Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from
                bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local
                agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief

                Terms of Service, you and Orion Digital Consulting are each
                waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a

                arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act

              <p>
                Orion Digital Consulting is always interested in resolving
                disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns
                can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by
                emailing customer support. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a
                party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the
                other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute
                (“Notice”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of
                the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief
                sought. If Orion Digital Consulting and you do not resolve the
                claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is
                received, you or Orion Digital Consulting may commence an
                arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of
                any settlement offer made by Orion Digital Consulting or you
                shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
                arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Orion
                Digital Consulting is entitled.
              </p>
              <p className="bold-text">d. Arbitration Procedures</p>
              <p>
                Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in
                accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”)
                rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration
                Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this
                Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit
                its website,{" "}
                <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                  http://www.adr.org
                </a>
                . Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes
                can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page,{" "}
                <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                  http://www.adr.org
                </a>{" "}
                as may be updated from time to time. If there is any
                inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of
                this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
                Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator
                determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
                Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
                arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of
                these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the
                arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues
                relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
                Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are
                usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
                judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages
                and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an
                individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.
                Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be
                overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unless Orion Digital Consulting and you agree otherwise, any
                arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient
                location for both parties with due consideration of their
                ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the
                parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination
                shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less,
                Orion Digital Consulting agrees that you may choose whether the
                arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
                submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by
                an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your
                claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined
                by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the
                arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned
                written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings
                and conclusions on which the award is based.
              </p>
              <p className="bold-text">e. Costs of Arbitration</p>
              <p>
                Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
                (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the
                AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration
                Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less,
                at your request, Orion Digital Consulting will pay all
                Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than
                $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that
                you are economically unable to pay your portion of the
                Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for
                any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion
                of the Arbitration Fees, Orion Digital Consulting will pay your
                portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the
                arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
                compared to the costs of litigation, Orion Digital Consulting
                will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems
                necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
                cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be
                governed by the AAA Rules.
              </p>
              <p className="bold-text">f. Confidentiality</p>
              <p>
                All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling,
                decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly
                confidential for the benefit of all parties.
              </p>
              <p className="bold-text">g. Severability</p>
              <p>
                If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision
                of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b)
                titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
                Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable,
                the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term
                or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes
                closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
                unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement
                shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the
                arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b)
                above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions
                and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable,
                then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null
                and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or
                unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public
                injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms of Service will
                continue to apply.

                Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the
                contrary, Orion Digital Consulting agrees that if it makes any
                future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change
                to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you
                may reject any such change by sending Orion Digital Consulting
                written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to
                the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future
                change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute
                between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration
                Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of
                Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of
                Service).

              You agree that Orion Digital Consulting, in its sole discretion,
              may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use
              of the Service and remove and discard any content within the
              Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack

              violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of
              these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or
              illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use
              of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement
              authorities. Orion Digital Consulting may also in its sole
              discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or
              any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any
              termination of your access to the Service under any provision of
              this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and
              acknowledge and agree that Orion Digital Consulting may
              immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related
              information and files in your account and/or bar any further
              access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Orion
              Digital Consulting will not be liable to you or any third party

              These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you
              and Orion Digital Consulting and govern your use of the Service,
              superseding any prior agreements between you and Orion Digital
              Consulting with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to
              additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use
              affiliate or third party services, third party content or third
              party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the
              laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
              law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject
              to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Orion Digital
              Consulting agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
              jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San
              Francisco County, California. The failure of Orion Digital
              Consulting to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
              Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or
              provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by
              a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
              nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect
              to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the
              other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force
              and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the
              contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related
              to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed
              within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or
              be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any
              notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or
              administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this
              agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as
              other business documents and records originally generated and
              maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of
              Service without the prior written consent of Orion Digital
              Consulting, but Orion Digital Consulting may assign or transfer
              this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction.
              The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience
              only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may
              be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also
              provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or
              other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally
